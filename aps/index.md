### What can Dropmyemail Archive APS do for you

Our APS package integrates Dropmyemail with Parallels Automation seamlessly. Your customers will be able to archive their emails, contacts, calendars and tasks on Dropmyemail. Customers can log in via single-sign-on to Dropmyemail. They will be able to view their archived data, perform e-discovery and restore their data on the Dropmyemail web application. We offer unlimited storage and an unlimited retention period. Please visit our [website](https://www.dropmyemail.com/business) for more information on other features.

### Business model of this application

Customers can are billed via seats. Each seat allows the customer to add one email account to be archived. Seats should be charged a fixed rate monthly or annually.

### Technical integration details

We require the partner to install our APS package as documented in our [installation instructions](/aps/installation).

Next, we need to configure your Exchange servers to establish a link between your servers to our servers. The link is necessary for automated provisioning. As each partner's setup is different, our technical team will be in touch with you to help you with the set up.
